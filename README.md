# MultiprotocolGateway


A Multi-Protocol Gateway can accept client-originated messages in various protocols. The service can then pass messages to a remote server with various protocols. The protocol that the client uses does not need to be the same as the protocol that the remote server uses.

A Multi-Protocol Gateway supports more than one client protocol. Similarly, the service can support more than one server protocol.
